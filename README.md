# Calculo-Cubicaje-Silos
Java Application. It program calculate the Silo cubic, also Celdas and Silo Bolsa. Usefull for Agroindustry purposes. 

Im using Java SE 8 with netBeans. Im writing it readme in english to practice. Sorry about that!

You can calculate the Silo cubic: cylinder area + lower cone + upper cone. Area Cilindro + cono inferior + copete).
Cell cubic: Cell length + cell width + cell height. 
Silo Bag cubic : Bag length+ bag width + bag base + bag parable. 
It designated to calculate diferent type of grains: Trigo, Maiz and Soja. With it own PH (hectolitric weigth).
Calculate the upper cone, posite and negative values. Also, accept 0 value, for razed Silo or Cell. 

You can add Silos, Cell and Silo Bag, as many as you want.
You can list all of them, and the program calculate to total of grains that you have in stock.

I used MVC pattern.
I used Vista Class for Vista, Gestion Class for Model, Silo Class for Silo Object, Celda Class for Cell Object, SiloBolsa Class for SiloBag Object
Every input number type is validate for the ValidarNumero() Function.
I used Iterator to iterate the ArrayList.
Implements comparable to comparete values in the searching function, after deletion elements of the ArrayList.

At your services,
